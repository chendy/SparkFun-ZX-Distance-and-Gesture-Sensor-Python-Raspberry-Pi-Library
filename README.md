Based off the [SparkFun ZX Distance and Gesture Sensor Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ZX_Distance_and_Gesture_Sensor_Arduino_Library)

Relies on [Adafruit Raspberry Pi Python Code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/tree/master/Adafruit_I2C)

## Run Instructions

1. wire up to Pi's I2C

2. navigate to /zxsensor/

3. then run the following terminal command:
```bash
python zx_sensor_demo.py
```

## Notes
